# Everything is An Experiment

The 1MillionDev stewards are committed to growing the Ethereum ecosystem.
We acknowledge that we don't have all the answers. Sometimes we'll get
things right, but more often then not we'll probably get a few things
wrong. <strong>That's where we need you.</strong>

We think the <strong> community</strong> is Ethereum's <strong>biggest asset</strong>.

Hence why we're helping onboard 1,00,000 new Ethereum developers.

Let us know how you think we are doing and what we an improve.
